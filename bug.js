This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This leads to unexpected behavior in the application because the app doesn't handle the intended route. This is particularly problematic on Android devices, where the delay in receiving the URL is more noticeable than iOS.
