The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of `getInitialURL()`.  The method might not have resolved by the time the application checks its value. To remedy this, ensure that you handle the method's asynchronous nature by wrapping it within an asynchronous function and making the application wait until the result is available. This can be done with async/await or Promises.   Here's how to resolve it using async/await:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

export default function App() {
  const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkInitialURL = async () => {
      const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
      setInitialUrl(url);
    };
    checkInitialURL();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (initialUrl) {
      // Handle the initial URL here
      console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl);
      // Navigate to the appropriate screen based on the URL
    }
  }, [initialUrl]);

  // ... rest of your app
}
```
This revised code ensures that the `getInitialURL()` call completes before attempting to use the value, resolving the intermittent null issue.
